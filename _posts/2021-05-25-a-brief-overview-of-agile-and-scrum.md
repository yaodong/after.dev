Agile is a set of values and principles, [not a methodology](https://blogs.harvard.edu/markshead/what-is-agile-methodology).

The [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) gives the actual definition of Agile in 68 words. None of the words speak to specific methods, procedures, and rules. However, people may refer to Agile as a methodology because they are confusing Agile, the values and principles, with the methods people use to follow those principles.

There are several methodologies teams can use to follow the Agile principles and values. [Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-scrum) is one of them. It has become the most widely used agile project management method by companies. Scrum teams commit to shipping working software through set intervals called Sprints. Their goal is to create learning loops to gather and integrate customer feedback quickly. In addition, they adopt specific roles, create special artifacts, and hold regular ceremonies to keep things moving forward. If you want to learn Scrum, the official [Scrum Guide](https://scrumguides.org/) and Atlassian's [Agile Coach](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum) are highly recommended.

Just following those ceremonies doesnâ€™t make the team Agile. Scrum comes with a lot of [responsibilities](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-scrum-master) and [requires relentless commitment](https://medium.com/serious-scrum/scrum-requires-relentless-commitment-c56c1a0ce9f2). So I would not be surprised if your team is [doing Scrum wrong](https://dzone.com/articles/10-common-scrum-mistakes-and-how-to-avoid-them) and your engineers [hate it](https://medium.com/serious-scrum/here-is-why-many-developers-hate-scrum-3a43baa015d1).

What's next? The following tutorials and books are worth investing time to read to get a comprehensive understanding of Agile and Scrum.
